# spacebucket

The goal of spacebucket is to provide flexible and intuitive overlay methods
familiar to GIS workflows. This works by doing the obvious finite-element
decomposition of all component edges in all inputs into triangles. Then
triangles *instances* are classified (by point-in-polygon lookup) by inclusion
within paths within objects within layers.

The resulting mesh and inputs and indexes can be used to derive complex
relationships between layers. Spacebucket is modelled on the concept of **data
fusion** from a now defunct commercial package called Eonfusion. It relies on
the RTriangle package which is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, but could be modified
to use the less restrictive `decido` package. Specialist forms of this might
choose other engines.

This is analogous to what GIS packages variously call "overlay", "topology
overlay", "intersection" and so on. The difference is we want a single mesh that
has information about all of its inputs in a lossless form. We can derive
general information from the mesh and the links to sources without simplifying
everything to a single result that has no connection to the sources.


## WIP

* holes are identifiable but not yet explicitly classified (see pfft for the machine)
* extend sb_intersection to return the right parts
* write sensible return types and input attributes



## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/spacebucket")
```

## Example

This example takes three built in data sets and merges them together as an indexed mesh. 

```{r example}
library(spacebucket)
plot(st_geometry(A), col = viridis::viridis(nrow(A)))
plot(st_geometry(B), col = "firebrick", add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(C), col = "dodgerblue", add = TRUE)

## summarize the contents
(bucket <- spacebucket(A, B, C))

## show the components pieces
plot(bucket, asp = 1)
```

The next stage is to then pull out the intersection layer, currently we only have a function
to plot the identified triangles - but work to come will identify them individually and copy attributes from the input layers appropriately. 

```{r}
spacebucket:::sb_intersection(bucket, col = "firebrick")

## it works with pairs or with multiple layers
spacebucket:::sb_intersection(spacebucket(A, B), col = "firebrick")

spacebucket:::sb_intersection(spacebucket(C, B), col = "firebrick")


set.seed(sum(match(unlist(strsplit("spacebucket", "")), letters)))
## number of layers is arbitrary
spacebucket:::sb_intersection(spacebucket(C, B, A, st_jitter(A, 0.1)), col = "firebrick")


```
