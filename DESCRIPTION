Title: Flexible and Intuitive Overlay Methods
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Michael", "Sumner", email = "mdsumner@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: General intersections via a triangle pool from disparate polygon inputs. Overlap is
 determined via finite-element decomposition of all component edges in all inputs into triangles. 
 Then triangles instances are classified (by point-in-polygon lookup) by objects within layers.
